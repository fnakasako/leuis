Below is a recommended **high-level architecture** for the **data broker** portion, given your requirements:

1. **Use Kafka for real-time data ingestion**  
2. **Retain ~10 days of recent data** in a fast, low-latency store (the “hot” store)  
3. **Move data beyond 10 days** into a more permanent, cost-effective, and scalable storage (the “cold” store) for longer-term analysis

The overall goal is to keep recent data quickly queryable (for real-time or near real-time use cases) while also accumulating historical data in a cheaper, more scalable environment for trend analysis, ML training, or batch analytics.

```

### Flow Explanation

1. **Data Sources** publish events to **Kafka**.  
2. A **Stream Processing** layer (e.g., Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, or Spark Structured Streaming) reads from Kafka, optionally transforms/enriches data, and writes to two destinations:  
   - **Hot Store**: A low-latency database or search engine with ~10 days retention.  
   - **Cold Store** (Data Lake / Warehouse): For longer-term storage and analysis.  
3. **Recent Data Queries** hit the hot store for near real-time analytics, powering RAG pipelines or immediate dashboards.  
4. **Historical & Trend Queries** go to the cold store (HDFS, S3, or a Lakehouse solution) for large-scale, long-term analytics.

---

## 2. Kafka for Real-Time Ingestion

1. **Producers** push events to **Kafka Topics**:
   - Could be from scrapers (arXiv, GitHub, news), user events, or any other real-time data feed.  
2. **Topic Management**:
   - Separate topics by source or data type (e.g., `arxiv_raw`, `github_events`, `dns_data`).
   - Retention settings in Kafka can be short (e.g., a few days) if you’re only using Kafka as a messaging backbone (the permanent storage will be elsewhere).
3. **Scalability**:
   - Kafka clusters handle high throughput, support partitioning for parallel reads/writes.

---

## 3. Hot Store (Low-Latency Database or Index)

You want to store **~10 days** of recent data in a system that supports:

- **Fast writes** (incoming data from Kafka)  
- **Low-latency queries** for real-time or near real-time analytics  
- **Automatic TTL (Time-To-Live) or rolling window** so data older than 10 days gets removed or archived

### Potential Technologies

1. **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch**  
   - Excellent for text-based searching, filtering, and aggregations.  
   - Natural fit if you frequently do full-text queries or need near real-time search.  
   - Supports rolling indices and retention policies.

2. **NoSQL Stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra)**  
   - Great for time-series or high-write workloads.  
   - Can set TTL on rows so data naturally expires after 10 days.  
   - Good for slice queries by timestamp.

3. **Time-Series DB (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)**  
   - Purpose-built for time-series data with retention policies.  
   - If your use case revolves heavily around time-series queries, this is ideal.

4. **OLAP Columnar Store (like ClickHouse)**  
   - Very fast analytical queries on recent data.  
   - Built-in support for TTL and partitioning by time.  

**Choice depends on**: query patterns, data formats, and your team’s expertise. If you expect a lot of text searching and flexible queries, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch is a strong option. For more structured time-series or numeric queries, Timescale/ClickHouse might be better.

---

## 4. Cold Store (Long-Term Storage)

After data ages out of the hot store (~10 days), or in parallel, you want it in a permanent, cost-effective storage for historical/trend analysis.

### Potential Technologies

1. **Hadoop (HDFS)**  
   - Traditional approach for storing large volumes of data in a distributed filesystem.  
   - Often used with Spark or Hive for batch analytics.

2. **Object Storage (AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob)**  
   - Scalable, cheap, durable.  
   - Can be queried with “serverless” solutions like Athena (AWS) or BigQuery (GCP).  
   - Many modern “data lakehouse” architectures build on S3/Blob.

3. **Lakehouse Platforms (Databricks, Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake)**  
   - Combine low-cost data lake storage with data warehouse-like features (ACID transactions, schema evolution).
   - Simplify streaming + batch data handling with the same underlying files.

### Loading Data to Cold Store
- **Stream Processing** writes data directly to HDFS/S3 in partitioned form (e.g., by date/hour).  
- Alternatively, run **batch jobs** (e.g., daily or hourly) that read from Kafka or from the hot store to archive data to the lake.

---

## 5. Stream Processing Layer

You’ll need a processing framework that reads from Kafka, optionally enriches/filters the data, and writes to both the **hot store** and **cold store**.

- **Kafka Streams**: If you prefer to stay within the Kafka ecosystem, easy to deploy as microservices.  
- **Apache Flink**: Great for continuous streaming with exactly-once guarantees, advanced windowing, and high throughput.  
- **Spark Structured Streaming**: Integrates well if you already use Spark for batch analytics or ML.  

### Typical Tasks
1. **Data Cleansing**: Removing HTML tags, normalizing text, etc.  
2. **Enrichment**: Adding metadata (timestamps, geolocation, lookups).  
3. **Aggregation or Pre-Indexing**: Summaries or rolling metrics (e.g., daily commit counts, trending topics).  
4. **Branching**:  
   - Write the enriched data to the **hot store** for immediate queries.  
   - Write the same or slightly summarized data to the **cold store** for historical analysis.

---

## 6. Query & Analytics

### 6.1 Real-Time Queries (Hot Store)
- **Latency**: Sub-second to a few seconds.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - RAG LLM queries that require the latest 10 days of content.  
  - Dashboards for operations or near real-time monitoring.  
  - Quick lookups (like “show me the last 1,000 GitHub commits referencing arXiv ID X”).

### 6.2 Historical & Trend Analysis (Cold Store)
- **Latency**: Seconds to minutes for big queries, depending on compute engine.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Monthly or quarterly trend reports.  
  - Large-scale ML model training that needs the entire historical data set.  
  - Deep analytics (like multi-year comparisons of research topics on arXiv).

---

## 7. Putting It All Together

**Step-by-Step Summary**:
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Multiple data sources (arXiv, GitHub, news, DNS, etc.) publish events to Kafka.  
2. **Stream Processing**  
   - A job (Flink, Spark, or Kafka Streams) reads Kafka data, transforms or enriches it.  
3. **Writing to Hot Store**  
   - Processed data is stored in a low-latency database (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Timescale) with a ~10-day retention window.  
   - This store is used for immediate queries, RAG pipelines, and real-time dashboards.  
4. **Archiving to Cold Store**  
   - The same stream processing job (or a separate job) writes data to a long-term data lake or warehouse (e.g., HDFS, S3, Lakehouse).  
   - This data is partitioned (e.g., by date/hour) and can accumulate indefinitely for historical analysis.  
5. **Query & Analysis**  
   - Real-time queries hit the **hot store** (small, recent data).  
   - Batch or historical trend queries run on the **cold store** with Spark, Hive, or Presto/Trino.  
   - If you adopt a lakehouse approach, you can unify streaming + batch seamlessly.

---

## 8. Additional Considerations

1. **Data Retention Policies**  
   - Ensure your hot store automatically deletes data older than 10 days.  
   - In Kafka, you can set a shorter retention if you only use Kafka as a buffer.  
2. **Schema Management**  
   - Tools like **Confluent Schema Registry** (Avro/Protobuf) or built-in Spark/Flink schema evolution can help maintain consistent data structures over time.  
3. **Scaling & Resource Management**  
   - Kafka, the hot store, and the cold store all need to scale horizontally if data volume grows quickly.  
   - Container orchestration (Kubernetes) is common for dynamic scaling.  
4. **Data Governance & Security**  
   - Role-based access to the hot store vs. cold store.  
   - Encryption at rest and in transit, depending on regulatory requirements.  
   - Logging & auditing for data access.  
5. **Observability**  
   - Metrics & logs from Kafka, the stream processor, the hot store, and the cold store.  
   - Tools like Prometheus + Grafana or the ELK stack for centralized monitoring.

## Final Thoughts

This **hybrid Lambda-like architecture** (real-time + batch) or even a **Kappa-like** approach (if you keep everything in streaming) sets you up to handle **two critical time horizons**:

- **Immediate (“Hot”) Data** for up to 10 days, supporting real-time retrieval and RAG LLM usage.  
- **Long-Term (“Cold”) Data** for historical trending and deeper analytics.  

By leveraging **Kafka** as the backbone, a **stream processing** layer for dual writes, a **low-latency store** for recent data, and a **scalable data lake/warehouse** for historical data, you achieve a balanced solution that meets near-term performance needs without sacrificing the ability to handle large-scale, long-term queries.
